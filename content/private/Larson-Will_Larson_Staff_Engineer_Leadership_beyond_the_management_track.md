learned a lot about how people think, how organizations are run, and how larger projects are prioritized. All — location: [1451]() ^ref-32086

A mistake I made early on in my one-on-ones was telling my manager what I thought they wanted to hear, instead of what I actually felt.” — location: [1500]() ^ref-14750

For traversing towards your Staff-plus promotion, a general template format that’s useful is: What are your Staff projects? What did you do? What was the project’s impact (including a well-defined goal)? What made this project complex? Keep it very short and then link out to supporting design documents What are the high-leverage ways you’ve improved the organization? What is the quantifiable impact of your projects? (Did you increase revenue by $10 million? Did you reduce year-on-year customer support tickets by 20%?) Who have you mentored and through what accomplishments? — location: [1474]() ^ref-37547

---
What glue work do you do for the organization? What’s the impact of that glue work? Which teams and leaders are familiar with and advocates for your work? What do they value about your work? One sentence, include data (e.g. survey data) when possible Do you have a real or perceived skill or behavior gaps that might hold you back? For each, how would you address the concern? One sentence each It’s — location: [1480]() ^ref-8786

If two people asked the same question, we immediately added it to a FAQ that we kept. — location: [2127]() ^ref-45705

I think that’s an important criteria for Staff-plus Engineers in product: not to just build something that ships, but for it to roll out smoothly and continue to succeed and grow over time with as few regrettable choices as possible. — location: [2196]() ^ref-9234

---
I’d occasionally read merged pull requests for repos that — location: [2327]() ^ref-37962

---
didn’t maintain; I’d read tech specs and proposals that are shared publicly; I’d occasionally attend various internal presentations from the data science and analyst teams where they presented projects they completed or ideas they’re exploring. — location: [2327]() ^ref-9312

pretty quickly. Slowly build up to those — location: [2390]() ^ref-20300

Make sure to write … A LOT. When thinking through problems or ideas, write it down (even if you don’t intend to share them). — location: [2393]() ^ref-16853

---
I’ll spend time breaking a long-term strategy into little chunks, doing research, and writing a proposal on that. Then I’ll have to market that proposal around the company. — location: [2443]() ^ref-61351

---
Staff-plus is all about enabling other people to do better work - to be a force multiplier. — location: [2531]() ^ref-15095

---
you’ll have to find or create a project yourself and advocate for it to happen. This is much harder but still plausible. — location: [2568]() ^ref-21391

---
at some point you should probably shift to focusing on working better with other people. — location: [2582]() ^ref-3375

speaking experience. Since then, we’ve had a couple of folks who’ve come and spoken at the meeting, and then went on to speak at company all-hands meetings or local meetups. At least one person ended up giving an expanded version of their talk at a big conference. We’ve also heard from folks that giving a talk at the confab was something they used as evidence — location: [2717]() ^ref-38120

One lesson that I learned was the importance of focus and prioritization. — location: [3194]() ^ref-59233

Having better alignment with leadership makes a lot of things much easier. — location: [3211]() ^ref-63121

---
a Staff+ Engineer’s work and responsibility is more than writing code. Basically what got you to senior level will not get you to Staff+. — location: [3316]() ^ref-24571

---
I feel like a Staff Engineering role is similar in that you’re leaving the comfort zone of a specific technical domain to a more general problem domain: engineering. — location: [3416]() ^ref-32043

the higher you get, the more your job becomes about mentoring and growing the people around you (and more broadly), — location: [3587]() ^ref-11521

projects. It becomes much more about seeing broader things and getting others on board. — location: [3589]() ^ref-63042

I try to find opportunities/gaps that I believe will set a direction for as many people as possible in the long term. — location: [3653]() ^ref-8425

When you document something you make it easy for anyone to access it and read in the future, it is easier to reference. — location: [3755]() ^ref-7764

Focusing on impact on business and company. Being collaborative: by joining meetings/working groups you should help achieve a better outcome. Technical knowledge. — location: [3879]() ^ref-55781
