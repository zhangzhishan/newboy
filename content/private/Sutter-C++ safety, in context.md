# C++ safety, in context
## Metadata
* Author: [[Herb Sutter]]

## Highlights
ISO C++ evolution is already pursuing Safety Profiles for C++. — location: [101]() ^ref-4216

---
We know the four kinds of safety that most urgently need to be improved: type, bounds, initialization, and lifetime safety. — location: [123]() ^ref-43624

---
For example, Microsoft ships a SafeInt library for C++ to handle integer overflows, which is opt-in. — location: [129]() ^ref-54372

---
memory-safe languages (MSLs) — location: [165]() ^ref-58486

---
Do use your language’s static analyzers and sanitizers. — location: [222]() ^ref-7589

---
Do keep all your tools updated — location: [227]() ^ref-53827

---
Do secure your software supply chain. — location: [228]() ^ref-60192

---
Do use package management for library dependencies. — location: [229]() ^ref-16941

---
C++ could enable turning safety rules on by default that would make code: fully type-safe, fully bounds-safe, fully initialization-safe, — location: [355]() ^ref-10995

---
change is never free. — location: [374]() ^ref-25753
